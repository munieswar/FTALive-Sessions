# Azure Classic Migration Overview

Azure Classic to ARM migrations refer to the process of moving supported resources from the Classic deployment model to the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) deployment model. This migration is necessary because Azure Classic is the older deployment model that has been replaced by the more modern ARM model. Moving to ARM provides organizations with a more comprehensive management and deployment experience that offers better control, flexibility, and security.
